# 🖤 Hi there! I'm Elisa

👩🏻‍💻 **Full Stack & Web3 Developer** — I build products and smart contracts, and I share the process through technical content.  
🧾 I also work as a **Technical Writer**, creating developer-focused documentation and tutorials.  
⛓️ My background is **Solidity** (Hardhat / Remix) and in the last year I went all-in on **Stellar + Soroban (Rust)**: learning by building, and building in public.

**Co-founder of [Buen Día Builders](https://github.com/BuenDia-Builders)** — a LATAM ecosystem where we build real Web3 products and help more women developers learn, ship, and grow.

## 🚀 What I’m working on
- Developing **smart contracts in Solidity** (Hardhat, Remix, ENS, Unlock Protocol).
- Freelance Web3 projects focused on **stablecoin payments, UX, and decentralization**.
- Writing technical content

## 🎥 YouTube: code-first content
On my channel I publish tutorials and sessions where I **code with people** and break down real development workflows.
